## Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment 
and practice with terraform and SQL


## Question 1. Google Cloud SDK

Install Google Cloud SDK. What's the version you have? 

To get the version, run `gcloud --version`

#
Google Cloud SDK 405.0.0
bq 2.0.78
core 2022.09.30
gcloud-crc32c 1.0.0
gsutil 5.14
#

## Google Cloud account 

Create an account in Google Cloud and create a project.

#
502119489709 - DE-taxis
#

## Question 2. Terraform 

Now install terraform and go to the terraform directory (`week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform`)

After that, run

* `terraform init`

#
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "local"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/google...
- Installing hashicorp/google v4.40.0...
- Installed hashicorp/google v4.40.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
#

* `terraform plan`

# 
# so - I modified the location from europe-west6 to us-west1 oregon low carbon but didn't change anything else

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creation complete after 3s [id=dtc_data_lake_micro-citadel-364322]
google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creation complete after 3s [id=projects/micro-citadel-364322/datasets/trips_data_all]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
#


Apply the plan and copy the output (after running `apply`) to the form.

It should be the entire output - from the moment you typed `terraform init` to the very end.

## Prepare Postgres 

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos

We'll use the yellow taxi trips from January 2021:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv
```
# downloaded from web page - also wrote small .py to convert the .parquet file to .csv


You will also need the dataset with zones:

```bash 
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv
```

Download this data and put it to Postgres

## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were there on January 15?

Consider only trips that started on January 15.


## Question 4. Largest tip for each day

Find the largest tip for each day. 
On which day it was the largest tip in January?

Use the pick up time for your calculations.

(note: it's not a typo, it's "tip", not "trip")


## Question 5. Most popular destination

What was the most popular destination for passengers picked up 
in central park on January 14?

Use the pick up time for your calculations.

Enter the zone name (not id). If the zone name is unknown (missing), write "Unknown" 


## Question 6. Most expensive locations

What's the pickup-dropoff pair with the largest 
average price for a ride (calculated based on `total_amount`)?

Enter two zone names separated by a slash

For example:

"Jamaica Bay / Clinton East"

If any of the zone names are unknown (missing), write "Unknown". For example, "Unknown / Clinton East".
